      <p>
        My wubbwubb <strong>Hannah</strong>,<br><br>
          Ello wubbwubb, I know it hasn’t been easy and you’re really just trying your best to get through each day. I want you to know that I see that effort, even in the little things you do. Some days may feel heavy and tiring, but the fact that you still keep going says so much about your strength. It’s not easy to show up every day, but you still do, and that’s something to be proud of. Even when you don’t feel like it, you’re doing so much better than you realize.

          I just want to remind you that you’re doing great, even if you don’t always see it. Getting yourself through each day is already an achievement, and it matters more than you think. I’m really proud of you for holding on and pushing forward despite everything. You deserve to rest when things get too much, and you don’t have to carry it all alone. Always remember, I’ll be here for you and I’m always cheering you on.
          <br><br>
        With all my love,<br>
        <strong>Rien</strong>
